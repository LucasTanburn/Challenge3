# Challenge3

This challenge consisted of 5 parts, all consisting of making a function involving a class that defines a 2D point:
```
class Point2D
{
    public:
        int x;
        int y;
};
```
1: A function that calculates the distance between two points, this is the function Distance in the code.  
2: A function that takes an array of points and sorts them by distance from the origin.  This is the function Point2DSort.  
3: A function that takes three points and determines if the angle made is a clockwise, anti-clockwise or collinear angle. This is the function Point2DAngle.  
4: A function that determines whether 2 finite lines (consisting of 2 points each) intersect. This is the function Point2DIntersect.  
5: A function that detemines whether a given point lies within a quadrilatiral shape, defined by four other points.  This is the function PolygonContain.  

The main function of the code is a set of commands with example points to demonstrate the commands that have been made.
